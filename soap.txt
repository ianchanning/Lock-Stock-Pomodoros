Soap: A minute ago this was the safest job in the world. Now it's turning into a bad day in Bosnia.
Soap: Yeah, little bit of pain never hurt anybody. If you know what I mean. Also, I think knives are a good idea. Big, fuck-off shiny ones. Ones that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good, because they don't make any noise, and the less noise they make, the more likely we are to use them. Shit 'em right up. Makes it look like we're serious. Guns for show, knives for a pro.
Soap: What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?

Soap: When the bottle in my arse has contracted, I'll let you know.
Soap: You mean to tell me that the only thing connecting us with the murders is in the back of your car which is parked outside?
Soap: You really think it's worth taking the risk for 700 pounds? Tom, you're a dick.
Soap: Tom, what have you been eatin'?
Soap: You did take care of the shotguns?
Soap: Do you really think it's worth taking the risk for £700?
Soap: Now.
Soap: I don't think it's the right move.
Soap: [Looks through bag with £500,000 Eddy brought back] What is going on?
Soap: Jesus.
